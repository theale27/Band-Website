# Band Website

This website was made for a University assignment in 2016 which was to advertise a band's tour by providing a responsive webpage with an Australia theme.

The website is made with PHP so that it can manage some content dynmically which means it will need to be hosted on a server to be able to view it.
A program such as [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) can be used to create a local server to host and view it.
